## Metadata Guide for Independent Songwriters

Effective metadata is crucial for protecting your rights, ensuring proper attribution, and maximizing discoverability. This guide outlines essential metadata practices for songwriters.

### Why Metadata Matters for Songwriters

*   **Copyright Protection:** Clearly identifies ownership of your songs.
*   **Royalty Collection:** Ensures you receive royalties for your work.
*   **Discoverability:** Helps listeners find your music on streaming platforms.
*   **Collaboration:** Facilitates clear agreements with co-writers.

### Key Metadata Elements for Songs

1.  **Song Title:** The official title of the song.
2.  **Writer(s):** Full legal names and contact information for all songwriters.
3.  **Copyright Notice:** e.g., © 2025 [Writer's Name]. All rights reserved.
4.  **Publisher(s):** Name(s) of the publishing company(ies) representing the writers.
5.  **Administrator(s):** Name(s) of the administrator(s) representing the writers.
6.  **ISWC (International Standard Work Code):** A unique identifier for the song itself.
7.  **ISRC (International Standard Recording Code):** A unique identifier for a specific recording of the song.
8.  **Contact Information:** Contact details for rights management and licensing inquiries.
9.  **Genre:** Relevant musical genres and subgenres.
10. **Mood/Themes:** Descriptors for the song's emotional tone and lyrical themes.
11. **Lyrics:** The complete and accurate lyrics of the song.

### Split Sheet for 5 Writers

A split sheet is a crucial document that outlines the ownership percentages of a song among its writers. Here's what to include when there are 5 writers involved:

| Writer Name        | PRO Affiliation | Email Address           | Percentage (%) | Signature |
| ------------------ | --------------- | ------------------------- | -------------- | --------- |
| Writer 1 (You)     | ASCAP/BMI/SESAC | your.email@example.com    | 20%            |           |
| Writer 2           | ASCAP/BMI/SESAC | writer2.email@example.com | 20%            |           |
| Writer 3           | ASCAP/BMI/SESAC | writer3.email@example.com | 20%            |           |
| Writer 4           | ASCAP/BMI/SESAC | writer4.email@example.com | 20%            |           |
| Writer 5           | ASCAP/BMI/SESAC | writer5.email@example.com | 20%            |           |

**Key Considerations:**

*   **Equal Splits:** Unless otherwise agreed, splits are typically divided equally among all writers.
*   **Written Agreement:** Always have a signed split sheet *before* the song is commercially released.
*   **PRO Affiliation:** Ensure all writers are affiliated with a Performing Rights Organization (PRO) like ASCAP, BMI, or SESAC.
*   **Record Everything:** Document the creative process, including contributions from each writer.
